# Assumptions Made

* Q1 and Q2 checks for the existence of input file. If the input file is invalid, program will be terminated with an error message.

* The input file MUST be a .txt file (both relative and absolute file path works)

* For Q2 the number of parts should be a single digit integer and it should be a factor of the file size.

* For Q3 if directory 'Assignment' doesn't exist, program will be terminated with an error message.
